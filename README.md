Current Weather is Populated with city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index
has a background color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. There is a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. Click on a city in the search history
to be presented with current and future conditions for that city
